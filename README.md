# test_exercise INSTUCTIONS on how to Execute the code



You dont need any spesific software to execute the code

Its more preferable to use Crome Browser V57 and above. You can edit the code with any
IDE or Editor you want. Personally i have used Eclipse IDE and C++ Editor to upload and test
the code.

Notice that are two files the INDEXA and INDEXB for the a and b questions of the coding task.



Regarding the second task notice in order to be able to see the results from the list of group created
you need to open Crome browser Console by pressing the keys control+shift+J or you can insted replace the command
console.log() with the alert () function or document.getElementById().innerHTML
