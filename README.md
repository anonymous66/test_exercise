# test_exercise INSTUCTIONS on how to Execute the code



You dont need any special software to execute the code

Its more preferable to use Crome Browser V57 and above. You can edit the code with any
IDE or Editor you want. Personally i have used Eclipse IDE and C++ Editor to upload and test
the code.

Notice that are two files the INDEXA and INDEXB for the a and b questions of the coding task.
